.SH NAME
\fIxdiskusage\fR - Grapical display of disk usage
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B xdiskusage
[-d[isplay] host:n.n] [-g[eometry] WxH+X+Y]
[-t[itle] windowtitle] [-n[ame] classname] [-i[conic]]
[-fg color] [-bg color] [-bg2 color]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I xdiskusage
displays the output of "du" in an X window, allowing you to
graphically compare the sizes that the files and directories take.

This program was inspired by, and the user interface design copied
from, the "xdu" program written by Phillip C. Dykstra
<phil@arl.army.mil>

.SH MAIN WINDOW

When you run it it presents you with a list of all the disks mounted
on your system (it found these by running "df").  Click one of these
names and it will scan the entire disk (by running "du") and present a
graphical display of how much space all the files are taking on that
disk.

You can click on several disks (or on the same disk multiple times,
for instance if you have changed the files stored on it) and get
multiple display windows.

The "rescan" button reruns "df" to get a new list of disks.  You need
to do this if you mount or unmount a disk.

The copyright button shows you the copyright.

You can also type in a pathname.  This is passed to "du" and can be
used if you are only interested in the space used by a certain
subdirectory.  Use of this field will prevent xdiskusage from showing
the (free) and (?) space.  If the named file is a symbolic link it is
dereferenced before being sent to du.

The "all files" button sends the -a switch to "du" causing it to list
the space for every file on the disk.  This can significantly increase
the time it takes to scan.

.SH DISK USAGE WINDOW

Each white box represents a directory.  It's size is equal to the sum
of all it's contents (all subdirectories and files).  To the right of
each box are stacked the boxes for the subdirectories.

If you selected a disk two special boxes are added: "(free)" is the
free space on the disk, and "(?)" is the difference between what du
reports and what is actually free (I think this is both unreadable
directories due to protection violations and the space needed to store
the directories themselves).  You may also see "(files)" which are
files in the root directory of the disk.

The left-most box is the "current directory".

Clicking on any box makes it the current directory: putting it on the
left edge and blowing it up to the height of the window and scaling
all it's contents the same.  Clicking on the current directory goes up
to it's parent directory.

To dismiss any window type Escape.

.SH MENU ITEMS

There is a pop-up menu on the right-hand mouse button.  Every item on
the menu has a keyboard shortcut.  The menu items are:

.B In (right arrow)
go to the first child of the current directory.

.B Next (down arrow)
go down to brother of current directory.

.B Previous (up arrow)
go up to the brother of current directory.

.B Out (left arrow)
go to parent of current directory.

.B Root (slash)
put the current directory back to the outermost one

.B Sort/Largest (s)
sort largest size at the top

.B Sort/Smallest (r)
sort smallest size at the top

.B Sort/Alphabetical (a)
sort in alphabetical order

.B Sort/Reverse Alphabetical (z)
sort in backwards alphabetical order

.B Sort/Unsorted (u)
sort in the order read from du.

.B Columns/2-11 (2-9,0,1)
arrange display to have N columns.

.B Copy to Clipboard (c)
the pathname of the current directory is put in the X clipboard (you
can then paste it into a shell command).

.B Print (p)
The current display is printed.  The output is Encapsulated
PostScript.  It will either run it through lpr (or any command you
choose) or send it to a file.

.SH BUGS

Should be able to name the disk as a command line option.

Gets confused by "df" output on some platforms, requiring
platform-specific code.
